"""Where the brush left ink, from a `write.py` log: the data the ink pass paints from.

Steps 3 and 4 of the project read the same thing -- `marks(log)` -- so the ink in
the rendered preview and the ink a compositor paints from `ink.json` are one set
of points.

## What counts as ink

The hair is a cone that may go into the floor (`brush.py`). A control step leaves
ink when the cone's apex is below the floor **and** the arm is lowering, writing
or lifting; the ink is centred where the cone's axis meets the floor and is as
wide as the cone's section there (`brush.ink_point`, `brush.section_width`, logged
by `write.py` as `ix`, `iy`, `width`). Anywhere else it would be the brush
dipping on the way somewhere; `write.py` reports that as stray ink and it is not
painted here, so a fault shows in the report rather than being quietly drawn.

Consecutive inked steps of one stretch form a **mark**: one continuous trace of
the brush -- one per stroke, when every stroke is written whole. Gaps shorter
than `GAP_S` inside a stretch are bridged at the smallest width, so a tip that
rises out of the floor for a step does not break a stroke in two.
